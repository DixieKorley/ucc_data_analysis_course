### Reading
**What is statistics and what is statistical thinking?**

When data turns into information, you need to make sense of the information with statistics. Statistics is the science of collecting, organizing, summarizing and analyzing infromation to make conclusions or answer questions. It's used as a way to measure confidence in any conclusions. 

Statistics is 4 parts
1. collecting information
2. organizing, summarizing information
3. analyzing information to make conclusions or answer questions. 
4. Report results

Data
Data > information
Data can be a number or text
Data can give you a lot of information but can also give you misinformation, so be careful and know when the data came from. 
For example, in the case that a conclusion may seem to be influenced by one variable, another variable could also be the reason why. This example is called lurking variable.
Data can vary, and becfause of this, the results we get can vary. So there is no 100% certainty that we can get in mathematics. 

**What is the process of statistics?**
Population - all subjects/individual to be studied.
Individual - each subject to be studied.
Sample - a subject of the population to be studied. 

Descriptive statistic - getting results for a sample without making general conclusions about the population. It's organizing and summarizing data through numerical summaries, tables and graphs. 

Inferential statistics makes general conclusions about a population by taking a result from a sample and comparing it to a population's result. 

Because we know that a sample is not enough to make an accurate generalization about a population, we include confidence as a measure of reliability - _confidence level_. 

Population parameter vs. statistic
Population parameter - numerical summery of a population
Statistic - also called sample statistic - numerical summary of a sample

Many non-scientific studies like internet polls, phone in polls, etc are based on convenience samples, also can be nonstatistical samples

**What is the process of statistics?**
1. Identify the research objective - a researcher has to determine the questions they need answered about the data > information. The questions have to be specific so they don't waste time with the data > information. 

2. Collect data needed to answer questions in the first step - you can't make conclusions about the population, so you need to pick a sample. For this step, make sure the data has been collected properly to make conclusions.

3. Describe the data - get an overview of the data using descriptive statistics

4. Make inferences about the data - make conclusions about the data using inferential statistics

**What is the difference between qualitative and quantitative variables?**

Variables are the characteristics of the individuals within a population. Variables can be quantitative or qualitative

Quantitative - numerical measures of individuals - discrete or continuous
Qualitative - categorical or ordinal 

Many problems may have more that one approach that can lead to a correct solution. It's not just one way with statistics. 
Approach - a way to look at and organize the problem.
