### Reading
The data you need to make a good decision are often not readily available. Even if you
have the resources to do primary research, you will not likely be able to gather all the
data you want. So you need a sample instead of a population.

You don't need all data to get started, so you can use a technique called **sampling.** 

**Population data** is all the data of all the subjects tested and it's hard to get due to number of subjects tested. 

**Sampling data** is a subset of population data. 

**Nonstatistical** or *nonprobability sampling* is when you pick a sample for convenience (maybe at random), because there is no statistical way to measure selecting the sample. It's good to test for ideas or trends.

**Statistical sampling** is random but you need some thought to select the sample group. It can be tested.

**Inferential statistics** can be used to test statistical sampling. It is a set of techniques used to determine population data conclusions using sampling data.

You need a **parameter** (population summary statistic) and **sample statistic** (sample summary statistic) to do inferential statistics. 

**Parameter** is a summary measure of population data
**Sample statistic** is a summary measure of sample data

There is no guarantee that inferential statistics may be accurate but using it to test statistical sampling can help analysts control possibility of error. 

The type of statistical sampling depends on data being collected, costs involved, and the goals of the analysis or decision. 

_Types of statistical sampling for e.g.:_
- simple random sampling (commonly used)
- systematic sampling
- stratified sampling
- cluster sampling
Simple random sampling, a type of statistical sampling just makes sure that every type of subject is chosen.You do that first by getting a list, called a frame. The frame is a list of elements in the population. It's too tedious to do by hand, so we use computer generation software to do it.
