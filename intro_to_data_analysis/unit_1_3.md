### Reading
The data you need to make a good decision are often not readily available. Even if you
have the resources to do primary research, you will not likely be able to gather all the
data you want. So you need a sample instead of a population.

You don't need all data to get started, so you can use a technique called **sampling.** 

**Population data** is all the data of all the subjects tested and it's hard to get due to number of subjects tested. 

**Sampling data** is a subset of population data. 

**Nonstatistical** or *nonprobability sampling* is when you pick a sample for convenience (maybe at random), because there is no statistical way to measure selecting the sample. It's good to test for ideas or trends.

**Statistical sampling** is random but you need some thought to select the sample group. It can be tested.

**Inferential statistics** can be used to test statistical sampling. It is a set of techniques used to determine population data conclusions using sampling data.

You need a **parameter** (population summary statistic) and **sample statistic** (sample summary statistic) to do inferential statistics. 

**Parameter** is a summary measure of population data
**Sample statistic** is a summary measure of sample data

There is no guarantee that inferential statistics may be accurate but using it to test statistical sampling can help analysts control possibility of error. 

The type of statistical sampling depends on data being collected, costs involved, and the goals of the analysis or decision. 

_Types of statistical sampling for e.g.:_
- simple random sampling (commonly used)
- systematic sampling
- stratified sampling
- cluster sampling
Simple random sampling, a type of statistical sampling just makes sure that every type of subject is chosen.You do that first by getting a list, called a frame. The frame is a list of elements in the population. It's too tedious to do by hand, so we use computer generation software to do it.

**Survey methods** are methods of collecting primary data, the main types are observation, experimentation and questioning.

Observing is measuring an output by watching a process and/or people. The observer gets information up front and does not rely on what subjects say. It is best for the observer to not let subjects know they are being watched. Observation is a popular way of collecting data.

Experimentation is setting up tests (food, drug, etc) and/or using subjects to test in order to determine their reaction.

Questioning is performing surveys or asking the same questions to all subjects, can be performed in face to face interviews, questionnaires, etc. They can be closed or open

Closed is easy to answer, can only respond a type of answer - like a multiple choice
Open is not easy to answer, and is difficult to analyze - like an open ended question

Guidelines for writing questions
1. Write simply and clearly
2. Ask one question at a time
3. Do not use too many options for multiple choice questions
4. Check that the questions are in the right order
5. Write an intro and set of directions for the respondents
6. Thank your respondents
7. Pilot the questionnaire
8. Revise and rewrite questions
9. Always assume the number of respondents will misread or ignore your directions or leave some questions unanswered.
