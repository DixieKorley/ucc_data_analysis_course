### Reading
Sorting takes two forms and it needs to be done first before you analyze data:
1. Determine which data are Quantitative, and which are Qualitative.  
2. Arrange the data in order so conclusions can be reached more easily.

sorting the data makes it very easy to calculate the Mean, Median and Mode. 

creating a chart with sorted data is much more useful than random data.

 if you have an odd number of data points the median will (for sure) be part of your data.
 
For an even set, the median will be the average of the two middle points.

With Quantitative data, sorting is easy.  The data are numerical therefore it is simple to re-organize it into an order from smallest to largest.

Qualitative data that can be sorted are called Ranked Data.  This means the data can be ordered according to size or quality.  Ranked data are sometimes called Ordinal Data.

Filtering the data refers to the process of eliminating certain parts of your data if they do not meet the requirements (criteria) defined by the scope of your analysis.
