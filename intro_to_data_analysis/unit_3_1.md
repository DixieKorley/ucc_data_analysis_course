# Normal Distribution

3 things come to mind:
- It's a bell shaped curve which means that the mean has the most data that's sitting around it on either side of the mean. Mean is the middle of the curve.

- Total area under the curve is equal to 1 

- Bell shape chart is symmetrical, so either half is 0.5 [0.5, 0.5]

# Standard Normal Distribution

Two additional things 
- Population Mean is equal to 0 and population standard deviation is equal to 1. [-1, 0, 1]

Measures of Central Tendency: Mode, Median,
and Mean

Mode - most frequent value
Median - middle data value

If dataset variable count is an odd number, use median = middle data values count - 1 divided by 2 to get the middle value count position that gives you the middle value

M position = Count - 1/2 

---
For even number of data values

Median position = ((count / 2) + ((count / 2) + 1)) / 2

M = sum of middle two values / 2

Or you can still do M position = (n + 1) / 2 for an odd number of values

If you use 100 values, and get 50.5 you will know that your two values to get the median are in the 50th and 51st position.

Mean is the average value of a dataset

Mean = sum of all data values / number of data values

Know how to calculate:
1. Mean
2. Median
3. Mode
4. Range

Know these too
- Variance and standard deviation
- Coefficient of variation = population standard deviation over population mean multiplied by a hundred
