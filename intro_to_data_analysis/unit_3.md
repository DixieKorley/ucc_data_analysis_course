# Normal Distribution

3 things come to mind:
- It's a bell shaped curved which means that the mean has the most data that's sitting around it on either side of the mean. Mean is the tipping point

- Total area under the curve is equal to 1 

- Bell shape chart is symmetrical, so either half is 0.5 [0.5, 0.5]

# Standard Normal Distribution

Two additional things 

- Population Mean is equal to 0 and population standard deviation is equal to 1. [-1, 0, 1]

Pages 76-96
Pages 104-106

Know how to calculate:
1. Mean
2. Median
3. Mode
4. Range

Know these too
- Variance and standard deviation
- Coefficient of variation = population standard deviation over population mean multiplied by a hundred
