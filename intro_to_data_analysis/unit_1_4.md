**Quanititave and qualitative data**

Quantitative - information that can be counted or expressed as numbers. It can be used in computations and statistical tests. Can be represented visually in tables and graphs. It asks, how many, how much.


Quantitative data can be discrete (finite number of values, space between a pair of values on the number line, e.g. number of pets owned) or conitinuous (possible values fall on a continuum, e.g. age or height, is it possible for values to take on fractions or decimals? Yes). 

**Quantitative data limitations**
- Cannot predict who will get a disease
- Not tell us how to fix a problem,
- Can help with ranking problems but doesn't tell us which problem to address first
- Insufficient by itself to make a decision

Qualitative data - Data that describes, explains and characterizes the subject of investigation using words not numbers. Why, not how much. Used to define a problem or generate new ideas for resedarch or intervention. 

Ways they are collected
- Focus groups
- Interviews
- Observation
- Archival material
