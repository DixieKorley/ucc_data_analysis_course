### Reading
**Quantitative and qualitative data**

Quantitative - information that can be counted or expressed as numbers. It can be used in computations and statistical tests. Can be represented visually in tables and graphs. It asks, how many, how much.

Quantitative data can be discrete (finite number of values, space between a pair of values on the number line, e.g. number of pets owned) or conitinuous (possible values fall on a continuum, e.g. age or height, is it possible for values to take on fractions or decimals? Yes). 

_Discrete Data_
Can only take on specific values within a range
In a range of 1 to 10, you may have the values of 2, 6, and 9
Example – number of children in a playground
Can only be whole numbers

_Continuous Data_
No gaps between the values within a range
In a range of 1 to 10, you could have all the values represented
Example – temperature at the playground
Could be any value including decimal places – not just whole numbers

**Quantitative data limitations**
- Cannot predict who will get a disease
- Not tell us how to fix a problem,
- Can help with ranking problems but doesn't tell us which problem to address first
- Insufficient by itself to make a decision

Qualitative data - Data that describes, explains and characterizes the subject of investigation using words not numbers. It can be categorical or ordinal.

**_Categorical Data_**
Elements can be arranged in categories that do not overlap
Generally analyzed by counting the number of responses in each category
Gives no indication as to preferences within one category or another

**_Ordinal Data_**
Values can be considered as a ranking of size or quality
Rankings can be grouped and analyzed together
Although this shows differences in preferences, it does not express this quantitatively

Why, not how much? Used to define a problem or generate new ideas for resedarch or intervention. 

Ways they are collected
- Focus groups
- Interviews
- Observation
- Archival material

**When to use quantitative research or qualitative research**

Qualitative research is used to uncover and understand thoughts and opinions, providing a basis for further decision making. 

Use when you need to develop hypothesis, understand feelings, identify needs, generate ideas, capture knowledge and uncover how people perceive a marketing message.

Quantitative research is used to measure and predict, leading to a final course or action. 

Use when you need to measure awareness, offer statistical validation, determine most desirable product concept, determine most effective price point or measure satisfacton

**Quantitative and qualitative data collection methods**

You need to collect data to perform scientific research. You can either study what people say or do, or you work with hard data. Identify the approach you need to take for your business first before you start analyzing.

In qualitative data, you do comparative analysis, where you point out differences between subjects. 

Imagine you're trying to understand how people feel about a new flavor of ice cream your small business has created. You can approach this in two main ways: asking them about their experience (qualitative) or looking at how many liked it based on sales data (quantitative). Let's break it down simply:

### Qualitative Research
- **What it is**: Like having a deep conversation with your customers. You ask them how they feel about the ice cream flavor, what they like or dislike, and why.
- **Why it's good**: It helps you understand not just what people think but the reasons behind their thoughts. You get to hear stories and details that numbers can't tell you.

### Quantitative Research
- **What it is**: Counting and measuring things. For example, you look at how many scoops of the new flavor were sold compared to others.
- **Why it's good**: It gives you clear, numerical data. It's like looking at the scoreboard at the end of a game to see who won.

### Research Measures
- **Qualitative Tools**: Surveys with open-ended questions, interviews, or group discussions where people talk freely.
- **Quantitative Tools**: Surveys with yes/no questions or ratings, sales figures, or any countable data.

### Mixed Methodology
- **What it is**: Using both conversations and counting. First, you might ask people detailed questions about why they like or don't like the ice cream. Then, you count how many prefer it over other flavors to see if the detailed feedback matches up with sales data.
- **Why it's good**: You get the full picture. You understand not just what's happening but why, and you can check if the deeper insights match up with the overall trends.

So, if you're trying to grow your customer base, you might start by really listening to what they have to say (qualitative) and then look at the numbers to see if what you learned lines up with broader trends (quantitative). Using both methods together (mixed methodology) can give you the best understanding of how to make your ice cream shop a hit.
