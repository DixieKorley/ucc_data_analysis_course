# Sources of data
### Reading

We need data to make informed decisions. 
```
Data -> Information -> Making decision based on information.
```
For example, Starbucks uses market research data to determine which locations they need to open in. This link should take you there but there should be an [update link](https://www.thebalancesmb.com/starbucks-use-of-market-research-propels-the-brand-2297155) in the classroom.

Before getting the data..
- First, identify the problem 
- Identify the decision a business needs to make
- Then decide what data to collect

Primary data is the data you need, you cannot work without it. Secondary data is data that was previously collected, not for your purpose.

Many web based sources of data are misleading, incomplete, biased or wrong so look carefully. You can go online for your data sources, but when you are doing research, it's good to reach out to a librarian. 

_Examples of information sources for secondary data can be found on page 4 of Analyzing Data and Making Decisions._
